*** Description of this repo ***

ModelMed Inc's Github repo for the CADD assignment for 8BA103 Project: Advanced programming & biomedical analysis. This repo contains all the files needed to create and use a neural network to predict whether a molecule, in SMILE format, is able to bind to DRD3.


*** Organization of this media ***

PCA.py                  A python file containing a PCA class

Tuning                  A python file that tunes hyperparameters

main.py                 A python file that predicts classes and writes it to a csv.
